###Asanames

An app to help practice the names of people at Asana. Mostly, I built this to practice with React (I got bored of the tic-tac-toe game I was building), and because I thought it would be fun.

All data pulled from Asana's publicly available pages.

#####To use:

`git clone`
`npm install`
`npm run build`

#####To auto-compile React and CSS (if developing or making changes on a local branch):

`npm run watch`
